# PingPongGame
  My first game created using java applet is Ping Pong Game.   
  
  Ping Pong Game is simple 2 player’s game.
  
  There are 2 paddles which you need to control so that ball can’t touch border.
  
  Player1 use left and right keys and player2 use ‘W’ and ‘S’ keys to move paddle up and down respectively.
  
  If any player failed then opponent of current player will win.
  
  "About Game.pdf" gives all information about game.
